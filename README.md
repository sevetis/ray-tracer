# Ray tracer
This is a simple ray tracer implemented in Rust


# Acknowledgement
This project is a Rust-based implementation of the ray tracing algorithms and scenes described in 
the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial series. 
The authors' clear explanations and step-by-step approach have been invaluable in guiding the development of this Rust ray tracer.
