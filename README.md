# Ray tracer
This is a simple ray tracer implemented in Rust


# Acknowledgement
This project is a Rust-based implementation of the ray tracing algorithms and scenes described in 
the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial series by Peter Shirley. 
The author's clear explanations and step-by-step approach have been invaluable in guiding the development of this Rust ray tracer.
